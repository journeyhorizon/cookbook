# Introduction
Course introduction, explaining the course structure & layout. Each session would be ranging from 15~30 minutes. At the end of each session we would have Q&A plus some quizzes and at the end of the course we would have a test to validate knowledge.
## Scope
Explain learning path & the course's goal

# I. The Fundamental
Common knowledge that can be used in daily conversation.
## 1. Decode the code
Debunk the mysterious word called "code". 
### 1.1) How a code came to life (What exactly is the developers are typing?)
### 1.2) IDE
### 1.3) Programming Languages & Level

## 2. Version Management
Explain how our engineer can find the sleepy head that cause the site to crash!
### 2.1) Git
### 2.2) Reusability
### 2.3) Library

## 3. Code smelling (Only smell, no need to cook)
A good developer can let other developers understand their code. A great engineer let non-technical understand their purpose.
### 3.1) KISS principle
### 3.2) Reading comprehension
### 3.3) Duplication problem
